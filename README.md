# Emmental-Game

This is a PHP object oriented programmation combat game with elements (and not cheese).
We failed our first project but we couldn't name two repository by the same name so instead of Elemental-Game, we called it Emmental-Game.

For games and for a lot of progamming applications, objects are not the most efficient way to run a program. But it's quite easy to understand the concept and it's very formative.

Enjoy ✌️.

Things to do : 
- Upgrade the code by using Enum classes for clean code. 
- Create a functionnal autoload file.
